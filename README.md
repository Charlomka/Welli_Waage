# Welli_Waage
I want to practice my python skills while also keeping track of my pet birds.

As often as they cooperate with me, I will weigh my 8 birds. 

I will then ask some simple questions:

What is the average weight per bird type (parakeets and cockatiels)?
Is the sex related to the weight? 
Is the age related to the weight? 

...

I also want to plot the data in form of some graphs.

I am using the Codecademy "Data Analysis" Career Path and the Skill Path "Data Visualization with Python" as a guideline.

I am still confused about how SQL will help in this (if at all) and how I will best provide and update the data. 

...

But first, I need to up my Github game because I still cannot make a useful connection between my desktop and this repository!
